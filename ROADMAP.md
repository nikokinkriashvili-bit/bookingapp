# BookingApp — Master Roadmap (step-by-step execution plan)

**This is the single ordered to-do list to get the app from today to a running pilot.**
Work top to bottom. Check items off here (`[ ]` → `[x]`, add the date). Each step says what "done" means.

- Deep detail lives in: [TECHNICAL_AUDIT.md](TECHNICAL_AUDIT.md) (gap analysis) and [audits/](audits/) (specialist findings). CLAUDE.md stays the build log.
- Feature-gap proposals ([audits/feature-gap-analysis.md](audits/feature-gap-analysis.md)) were decided July 2026: F1/F2/F4/F5 merged below (3.6, 4.1b, 4.3-prereq, 4.3b), F6–F10 = Stage 4½, **F3 coating warranty rejected — do not build**.
- Importer/wholesaler module planning: [IMPORTER_MODULE_PLAN.md](IMPORTER_MODULE_PLAN.md) — feature proposals feeding Niko's importer TRD (5.3); builds as Stage 8 after the TRD is confirmed.
- ⚙️ = code (Claude builds) · 🖐 = Niko action (dashboard/paperwork/decision) · 🧪 = verification gate
- Standing rule per step: typecheck + lint clean, tested at 375px where visual, CLAUDE.md updated, committed. One step per commit unless marked as a batch.

## Stage 0 — Land what's already done *(first session, blocks everything)*

- [ ] **0.1** ⚙️ Commit the July bug-audit fixes currently sitting uncommitted in the working tree (migration 010 file, atomic stock wiring, PO mark-sent fix, calendar overlap, parseDecimal, jobActions seams, confirm/error surfacing, WhatsApp field, i18n additions, audit docs).
- [ ] **0.2** 🖐 Run `supabase/010_atomic_stock.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor. *Done = both statements succeed (see the file's note if the unique index fails).*
- [ ] **0.3** 🖐 Two dashboard checks (5 min): Auth → email confirmation is **ON**; Database → note current backup settings. Record both in `audits/security-data-integrity.md` (S3 checkbox).

## Stage 1 — Safety net *(CI + tests before any new features)*

- [ ] **1.1** ⚙️ GitHub Actions workflow: `tsc --noEmit` + `expo lint` + `expo export --platform web` on every push/PR. *Done = a red X appears on a deliberately broken test push.*
- [ ] **1.2** ⚙️ Jest (`jest-expo`) + unit tests for the five pure-logic modules: `inventory` (reorder math), `consumption` (delta logic, mocked rpc), `calendarDate`, `number` (comma cases), `jobStatus` (summaries). Add `jest` to the CI workflow. *Done = ~40+ assertions, CI green.*
- [ ] **1.3** ⚙️ Root error boundary with a bilingual "something went wrong — reload" screen.
- [ ] **1.4** ⚙️ Auth gate in the root layout: signed-out users deep-linking anywhere get `/login` (keep `/login`, `/sign-up` public; leave room for the future public booking route).
- [ ] **1.5** ⚙️ Error-vs-empty states on list screens: failed fetches show a banner + retry, not an empty list (calendar, vehicles, customers, inventory, POs, dashboard).

## Stage 2 — Database integrity *(one migration, one session)*

- [ ] **2.1** ⚙️ Write `supabase/011_integrity_and_indexes.sql` from the draft spec in [audits/security-data-integrity.md](audits/security-data-integrity.md): pre-flight cleanup queries, CHECK constraints (end>start, stock≥0, qty>0), `customer_vehicles` both-sides RLS fix, **drop the linked-supplier PO-update policy** (S1), all missing indexes, `schema_migrations` table.
- [ ] **2.2** 🖐 Run the cleanup queries first, review results, then run 011. *Done = `select * from schema_migrations` lists 001–011.*
- [ ] **2.3** ⚙️ Housekeeping batch: remove unused beta deps (`@expo/ui`, `expo-glass-effect`, `expo-symbols`, `expo-device`); verify export still clean.

## Stage 3 — Intake speed + polish quick wins *(the <30s requirement)*

- [ ] **3.1** ⚙️ Intake defaults: From = today + now rounded up to 15 min when no date param. ([audits/intake-speed.md](audits/intake-speed.md) R1 — biggest UX win in the app.)
- [ ] **3.2** ⚙️ Date/time quick chips (Today/Tomorrow · Now/+1h/presets) + numeric keyboard on those fields (R2, R3).
- [ ] **3.3** ⚙️ Accessibility quick pass ([audits/accessibility.md](audits/accessibility.md)): hitSlop ≥44pt on steppers/×/nav arrows; `accessibilityLabel` on icon-only buttons (new i18n keys, both languages); darken light-theme `muted` token to pass 4.5:1.
- [ ] **3.4** ⚙️ Localization fixes ([audits/localization.md](audits/localization.md)): `po.expectedDeliveryShort` key replaces the `.split(" (")` hack (L2); rename `common.to` → time-range separator key (L3).
- [ ] **3.5** 🖐 Decision: month-grid 9px text redesign (count badges vs. denser chips) — pick a direction, then ⚙️ implement.
- [ ] **3.6** ⚙️ Light up the two "materials" dashboard balloons with real spend from received POs (F1 — the data exists now; placeholders retire).

## Stage 4 — Feature backlog *(Niko-approved order; one feature per step, stop-and-confirm between each)*

- [ ] **4.1** ⚙️ Photo capture + before/after gallery on vehicle profile. **Requirements:** Supabase Storage with per-business RLS on the bucket; client-side compression from day one (~300KB/photo — see [audits/cost-scaling.md](audits/cost-scaling.md)); R2 migration seam documented.
- [ ] **4.1b** ⚙️ Vehicle condition check-in (F2): per-job damage record at intake — body/glass/wheels/interior checklist + note + tagged photos (rides on 4.1); shown on the job and included in the 4.7 receipt.
- [ ] **4.2** ⚙️ Rebooking/maintenance reminders (BRD §5.1): reminder schedule per job/service, due-reminders surface for the owner; WhatsApp send stays a seam. *(Coating-warranty variant F3 rejected by Niko — generic reminders only.)*
- [ ] **4.3** ⚙️ Public booking link (`/book/<slug>`, BK-01): public route (carve-out in the 1.4 auth gate), business slug, service+slot picker respecting working hours, booking lands as `booked` job. Anti-abuse via Edge Function rate limit. **Prerequisite (F4): `business_closures` table (holiday/vacation date ranges) respected by the slot picker and the calendar.**
- [ ] **4.3b** ⚙️ Manual payment recording (F5): `payments` table arrives now (migration) — record amount + method (cash/transfer/BOG-link) on a job; partial payments tracked; `paid` status auto-flips at zero balance; "pending payments" stat uses true remaining balances. BOG (6.3) later becomes one more writer to the same table.
- [ ] **4.4** ⚙️ Deposit collection at booking (BOG seam): deposit fields on job + booking flow, recorded through 4.3b's payments table; real charge waits for Stage 6.
- [ ] **4.5** 🖐→⚙️ Capacity limits — **blocked on Niko's definition** (bays? staff count? max concurrent jobs?). Define, then build into intake + public booking.
- [ ] **4.6** ⚙️ Push notifications (`expo-notifications` + device-tokens table): owner alerts (low stock, overdue, no-show). **Customer-facing confirmations carry confirm/reject actions that update job status** (standing Niko requirement — applies to WhatsApp later too).
- [ ] **4.7** ⚙️ Downloadable receipt (PDF) from a completed/paid job.
- [ ] **4.8** ⚙️ Repeat-last-order shortcut (completes the intake-speed story for regulars).
- [ ] **4.9** ⚙️ Services soft-delete (`archived` flag, migration 012) — closes audit finding D3 properly.

## Stage 4½ — Post-pilot wave *(F6–F10, order set by pilot feedback — re-rank before starting)*

- [ ] **4½.1** ⚙️ Customer-facing live status page (F6): tokenized public job URL — status, ETA, progress photos; link sent in the WhatsApp confirmation once 6.2 is live.
- [ ] **4½.2** ⚙️ Job profitability (F7): margin per job & per service type from consumption cost — needs a few months of real PO/consumption data first.
- [ ] **4½.3** ⚙️ Waiting list / cancellation backfill (F8).
- [ ] **4½.4** ⚙️ Staff commission report (F9): % per staff member, monthly earned-per-staff.
- [ ] **4½.5** ⚙️ Owner end-of-day digest push (F10, on 4.6 infrastructure).

## Stage 5 — Paperwork track 🖐 *(start NOW, runs parallel to Stages 1–4; these are the long poles)*

- [ ] **5.1** 🖐 **Bank of Georgia merchant account** (businessonline.ge) — weeks of lead time; blocks 6.3.
- [ ] **5.2** 🖐 Resolve WhatsApp Business entity (Niko's entity vs. Carbros') and start Meta business verification — blocks 6.2.
- [ ] **5.3** 🖐 Importer-module TRD (in Cowork) — unblocks landed cost/FX, fulfilment pipeline, NBG (6.4). **Feature proposals + the 7 decisions the TRD must settle are pre-drafted in [IMPORTER_MODULE_PLAN.md](IMPORTER_MODULE_PLAN.md); confirmed scope becomes Stage 8.**
- [ ] **5.4** 🖐 Decisions: open vs. invite-only signup for pilot (S4) · Vercel Hobby→Pro · pilot detailer shortlist.

## Stage 6 — Integrations *(last by design; each behind its existing seam)*

- [ ] **6.1** ⚙️ Supabase Edge Functions skeleton: functions repo layout, secrets, deploy flow documented in the runbook.
- [ ] **6.2** ⚙️ WhatsApp Cloud API: send function called from `fireStatusSeams`, `messages_log` table (migration), bilingual template pairs approved by Meta, customer language preference column. *Depends on 5.2.*
- [ ] **6.3** ⚙️ BOG payments: payment-link creation + webhook receiver Edge Function, `payments` table (migration), `paid` status driven by webhook; deposits (4.4) go live. *Depends on 5.1.*
- [ ] **6.4** ⚙️ NBG rate fetch — only when the importer TRD (5.3) lands.

## Stage 7 — Pilot readiness 🧪 *(gates launch)*

- [ ] **7.1** 🖐 **Supabase Pro upgrade** (real backups — non-negotiable before real business data) + staging project; ⚙️ `.env` split; every migration runs on staging first from now on.
- [ ] **7.2** ⚙️ Sentry wired to production (crash visibility on pilot phones).
- [ ] **7.3** 🧪 Real-device pass (iOS + Android, unblocked network): Georgian 375px layout sweep (L1) · Android `ka-GE` dates (L4) · font-scaling + web tab-through (A5/A6) · **stopwatch intake measurement** per the protocol in audits/intake-speed.md (target: Flow 1 median <25s).
- [ ] **7.4** ⚙️🖐 Seed Carbros production data: real services, products, suppliers, staff; owner walkthrough.
- [ ] **7.5** ⚙️ Ops runbook (RUNBOOK.md): run a migration, restore a backup, read Sentry, rotate keys, add a pilot business.
- [ ] **7.6** 🧪 **Pilot launch:** Carbros live for 2 weeks → fix what breaks → onboard 2–3 network detailers (5.4 shortlist).

## Definition of "the app works"

Every box in Stages 0–3 and 7, plus 4.1–4.4 + 4.6–4.8, plus 6.1–6.3, checked. Stage 4.5 ships if defined; 6.4 waits for the importer TRD. When that set is green, the platform does end-to-end what the TRD promised: book → work → notify → pay → restock — bilingually, on a phone, in under 30 seconds per booking.

## Progress log
